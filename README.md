A discord bot to count how many times your friend screw something up

My motivation and ideia comes from two places: a streamer called [Filipe Ramos](https://www.twitch.tv/filiperaaamos) from Brasil which have a counter on twitch that viewers can add everytime [V1sconde](https://www.twitch.tv/v1sconde) did screw something up, and one of friends in my group is kinda like that, so I thought would be funny have a counter like that.

## Code
I think it's pretty basic, but that's what supposed to be, a project to learn more and have fun.

You can add any phrases you want, just remember to format like the examples on the phrases file. The code cycle through the phrases, choose one randomly and not use the same twice in a row. I know it have better ways to write this, maybe I work this later.
